        <br>
        <div class="cntr"><a href="https://www.mediafire.com/file/b9tp9ngwgiafh1m/s_the_skeleton_v1.4.0.nar/file">Download his latest .nar file here!</a></div>
        <p>S the Skeleton is an Undertale based OC of mine. He's a chill skeleton who just wants to take care of his family, but is haunted by a dark past.</p>
        <p>S is by far my most detailed and dynamic ghost, I've put an absurd amount of hours into developing him. He has a friendship system, so if you treat him kindly you'll unlock more and more content. If you treat him poorly... honestly that route isn't very fleshed out yet, but it exists.</p>
		<p>I often use S as a test bed for new ideas, so he has a lot of little features! My main goal for him is that he feels like a buddy with a life of his own back home, so I've also been putting a lot of focus on writing large amounts of dialogue for him.</p>
        <img src="img/S_01.png" alt="S's main menu" width="443" height="354" class="center">
        <p>Double click him anywhere but his face to bring up his menu, and explore from there! He'll also give you some info right on the main menu, such as the date and time, current season, and tempurature/moon phase if you've got weather checking enabled.</p>
        <div class="centerreg"><div class="sBs"><img src="img/S_02.png" alt="S's family menu" class="center" width="411" height="323"></div> <div class="sBs"><img src="img/S_03.png" alt="S's timeline menu" class="center"width="411" height="323"></div></div>
        <p>One of S's biggest features is his family menu, which has 14 family members for you to unlock and ask about. As you unlock more family members, he'll gain more dynamic dialogue! This affects his random dialogue, some menu dialogue, and a lot of what he has to say when you ask about other family members. There's a lot to explore!</p>
        <p>He also has a large menu related to AU versions of himself! These don't generally add to the dynamic dialogue, but there is a lot to explore here! Many of the timelines can only be unlocked when you've spent a lot of time with S and he really trusts you.</p>
		<p>As of 1.4.0, S now has a daily dialogue system! He has at least 1 dialogue for every day of the year (including leap years), and has an additional 5% chance to say that dialogue if he hasn't said his daily dialogue yet that day. It's not much, but hopefully it means there's always something new, even if it's pretty small! He will not say daily dialogues if you never close him, so be mindful of that.</p>
        <p>And much more that I can't fit here! I'm always adding new things to S, so keep an eye out for updates!</p>
        <p>Don't mind spoilers and want to know how to unlock some of S's more hidden content? Check under the spoiler tab at your own risk.</p>
        <br>

		<div class="collapsible-content">
			<h2>RYS mode</h2>
			<img src="img/S_04.png" alt="RYS Mode" width="221" height="292" class="center">
			<p>RYS mode can be unlocked by booting S while certain conditions are met. He doesn't have as much content as normal S, but I do hope to add more to him in the future!</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Learn about at least 1 of S's family members, by clicking on their highlighted names in his random dialogue.</li>
				<li>Go to the 'do something' menu, and click 'Check'. Investigate for more details.</li>
				<li>Go to his question menu and ask him about his LV.</li>
				<li>Boot him on August 25th or at 8:25, AM or PM.</li>
				<li>After you've spoken to RYS a few times, if you close him and open the ghost again, you'll be back to S. Ask him about RYS in his question menu, and you'll unlock an option on the main menu to switch between the two at will.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>You can ask RYS questions about himself and his life, and eventually he may ask you a question or two if you're kind to him. You can also change his name, and perform standard actions like petting and hugging.</p>

        <h1>Version history</h1>
		<label class="collapsible">Version 1.4.x - Dialogue, dialogue, and dialogue</label>
		<div class="collapsible-content">
		
		 <div class="centerhead"><b>=====1.4.0=====</b>
                <div class="ctr">(5/1/21)</div></div>
            <ul>
                <li>Added a bunch of new random dialogues, and some extra dialogues in other places.</li>
				<li>Added a new daily dialogues system. S has at least 1 dialogue for every day of the year while on the positive route, and if you haven't seen that day's dialogue he'll have a 5% chance of saying it instead of his normal dialogues.</li>
				<li>Restructured all of S's random dialogues, nearly all probability issues have been eliminated! His random dialogues should be much more varied now.</li>
				<li>S will no longer fall asleep randomly if you're the one prompting him to speak. He also won't wake up randomly if you're the one prompting him to speak, unless you get him into a chain nightmare. This should allow you to explore more of his dialogues without him randomly changing modes on you.</li>
				<li>If S just fell asleep, you now have around 30 seconds to double click him and wake him back up before he's fully asleep.</li>
				<li>Made the changelog nicer!</li>
				<li>You can now boop S's secret mode character!</li>
				<li>Fixed a bug where S would never stop drinking on some operating systems (hopefully)</li>
				<li>Fixed it so S's best dreams are actually available if you pet him enough while he's sleeping.</li>
				<li>S can actually recognize his own birthday now! Somehow I had completely screwed up those checks.</li>
				<li>Fixed a lot of misc bugs, as well as stray pixels, typos, incorrect dialogue formatting, and word wrap issues.</li>
				<li>Lots of under the hood changes to make developing easier. Plenty more to come in the future as well. They're my gift to me.</li>
            </ul>

		<label class="collapsible">Version 1.3.x - Autumn, Sleeping, and Holding Obsidian</label>
		<div class="collapsible-content">
		
            <div class="centerhead"><b>=====1.3.0=====</b>
                <div class="ctr">(10/1/20)</div></div>
            <ul>
                <li>Added an Autumn themed shell! It comes with an accessory you can put on him with his right click menu.</li>
                <li>Fixed weather checking again. From now on I should be able to update it on my end without needing to patch S.</li>
                <li>You may need to reset your weather location if you're outside the US. However, you should now be able to get the tempurature in celcius if you use a page in celcius!</li>
                <li>Auto weather checks will no longer open the balloon, and should happen completely silently.</li>
                <li>S can fall asleep randomly now! He may sometimes have bad dreams; you can pet him to make him have more pleasant dreams for a while.</li>
                <li>S can pick up <a href="dusty.html">Obsidian</a> if you drag her onto him! Don't do it until I update Dusty, though, or it may behave weirdly.</li>
                <li>More dialogue and bugfixes all around.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
			
            <div class="centerheadsm"><b>---1.3.1---</b>
            <div class="ctr">(10/17/20)</div></div>
            <ul>
                <li>Fixed weather checking (I swear this is the last time... probably). Non-US urls SHOULDN'T give any more trouble, and if they do, S will direct you to another way of inputting it. Please let me know if this gives you any issues! As a result of this change...</li>
                <li>There is now a toggle in the config menu for Celsius vs Fahrenheit! You should be able to switch between them seamlessly.</li>
                <li>Changed the date/time/etc on the bottom of S's menu to have a slightly smaller font, to give it more room.</li>
                <li>Added a bunch more dialogue for falling asleep and waking up!</li>
                <li>Added a few extra lines of dialogue in various places.</li>
                <li>Balloon files will now be hosted separately from S's update files, so fresh installs will no longer want to redownload the balloon files.</li>
                <li>Fixed some typos, fixed a few small bugs, tightened up some code and made the formatting nicer.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
        
            <div class="centerheadsm"><b>---1.3.2---</b>
            <div class="ctr">(10/17/20)</div></div>
            <ul>
                <li>I've updated the way S holds <a href="https://zichqec.github.io/s-the-skeleton/dusty.html">Obsidian</a>, please make sure you also update Dusty before making him hold her again! Also, if you ever have trouble with S not picking up Obsidian, reloading him seems to help.</li>
                <li>Commu dialogue should no longer cause issues when S is in modes other than default.</li>
                <li>Fixed the error messages for weather checking.</li>
                <li>He has some new dialogue, if you try to get <a href="http://www.drdowasure.com/gaster/">Gaster</a> to talk to him...</li>
                <li>A few more misc tweaks, mostly behind the scenes stuff.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

			<div class="centerheadsm"><b>---1.3.3---</b>
            <div class="ctr">(11/17/20)</div></div>
            <ul>
                <li>If you boot S and he's asleep, and no other ghosts are present, you should now have an option to switch to another (random) ghost.</li>
				<li>Fixed some major issues in his communication dialogues.</li>
				<li>Hopefully fixed an issue where, if you booted S while Dusty was also present, he would sometimes go into sleep mode.</li>
				<li>Made OS version detection better, for the purposes of setting a wallpaper as Spanned (Windows 10/multi monitor only feature).</li>
				<li>Fixed header code and made it a lot lighter.</li>
				<li>Cleaned up some more code.</li>
				<li>Fixed a small visual issue while S was holding Obsidian.</li>
				<li>Added a couple extra dialogues.</li>
            </ul>

        <li>He may also comment if you plug in a tablet, if you allow him to see programs on your PC.</li>
        <li>S can now display email headers when he checks your email!</li>
        <li>You can boop his nose if your friendship is high!</li>
        <li>Lots of new dialogue, patched bugs, a few new expressions, and cleaned up code! Drastically less spaghetti.</li>
        <li>Balloons and position on screen will now sync across shells.</li>
