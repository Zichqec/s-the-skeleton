        <h1>S the Skeleton</h1>
        <img src="img/SThumb.png" alt="S's thumbnail" width="300" height="225" class="centersq"><br>
        <div class="cntr"><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/file/83ien6uaip67uja/s_the_skeleton_v1.3.3.nar/file">Download his latest .nar file here!</a></div>
        <p>S the Skeleton is an Undertale based OC of mine. He's a chill skeleton who just wants to take care of his family, but is haunted by a dark past.</p>
        <p>S is by far my most detailed and dynamic ghost, I've put more than 100 hours into developing him. He has a friendship system, so if you treat him kindly you'll unlock more and more content. If you treat him poorly... honestly that route isn't very fleshed out, but it exists.<br><br>Some of S's features may feel a little lacking, and that's because I'm not done with them yet! I wanted to get a basic framework running so that I can flesh him out with lots more dialogue and many more options. I have so much more content planned. Turn on auto updates if you want him to let you know when there's something new! He'll never update without your approval.</p>
        <br>
        <img src="img/SMainMenu.png" alt="S's main menu" width="443" height="354" class="center">
        <br>
        <p>Double click him anywhere but his face to bring up his menu, and explore from there! He'll also give you some info right on the main menu, such as the date and time, current season, and tempurature/moon phase if you've got weather checking enabled.</p>
        <br>
        <div class="centerreg"><div class="sBs"><img src="img/FamilyMenu.png" alt="S's family menu" class="center" width="411" height="323"></div> <div class="sBs"><img src="img/Timelines.png" alt="S's timeline menu" class="center"width="411" height="323"></div></div>
        <br>
        <p>S's biggest feature is his family menu, which has 14 family members for you to unlock and ask about. As you unlock more family members, he'll gain more dynamic dialogue! This affects his random dialogue, some menu dialogue, and a lot of what he has to say when you ask about other family members. There's a lot to explore!</p>
        <br>
        <p>He also has a large menu related to AU versions of himself! These don't generally add to the dynamic dialogue, but there is a lot to explore here! Many of the timelines can only be unlocked when you've spent a lot of time with S and he really trusts you.</p>
        <br>
        <p>And much more that I can't fit here! I'm always adding new things to S, so keep an eye out for updates!</p>
        <br>
        <p>Don't mind spoilers and want to know how to unlock some of S's more hidden content? Check under the spoiler tab at your own risk.</p>
        <br>

		<div class="collapsible-content">
			<h2>RYS mode</h2>
			<img src="img/RYSThumb.png" alt="RYS Mode" width="221" height="292" class="center">
			<p>RYS mode can be unlocked by booting S while certain conditions are met. He doesn't have as much content as normal S, but I do hope to add more to him in the future!</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Learn about at least 1 of S's family members, by clicking on their highlighted names in his random dialogue.</li>
				<li>Go to the 'do something' menu, and click 'Check'. Investigate for more details.</li>
				<li>Go to his question menu and ask him about his LV.</li>
				<li>Boot him on August 25th or at 8:25, AM or PM.</li>
				<li>After you've spoken to RYS a few times, if you close him and open the ghost again, you'll be back to S. Ask him about RYS in his question menu, and you'll unlock an option on the main menu to switch between the two at will.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>You can ask RYS questions about himself and his life, and eventually he may ask you a question or two if you're kind to him. You can also change his name, and perform standard actions like petting and hugging.</p>

        <h1>Version history</h1>
		<div class="ver">
            <div class="centerheadsm"><b>---1.3.3---</b>
            <div class="ctr">(11/17/20)</div></div>
            <ul>
                <li>If you boot S and he's asleep, and no other ghosts are present, you should now have an option to switch to another (random) ghost.</li>
				<li>Fixed some major issues in his communication dialogues.</li>
				<li>Hopefully fixed an issue where, if you booted S while Dusty was also present, he would sometimes go into sleep mode.</li>
				<li>Made OS version detection better, for the purposes of setting a wallpaper as Spanned (Windows 10/multi monitor only feature).</li>
				<li>Fixed header code and made it a lot lighter.</li>
				<li>Cleaned up some more code.</li>
				<li>Fixed a small visual issue while S was holding Obsidian.</li>
				<li>Added a couple extra dialogues.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
        </div>
        <div class="ver">
            <div class="centerheadsm"><b>---1.3.2---</b>
            <div class="ctr">(10/17/20)</div></div>
            <ul>
                <li>I've updated the way S holds <a href="https://zichqec.github.io/s-the-skeleton/dusty.html">Obsidian</a>, please make sure you also update Dusty before making him hold her again! Also, if you ever have trouble with S not picking up Obsidian, reloading him seems to help.</li>
                <li>Commu dialogue should no longer cause issues when S is in modes other than default.</li>
                <li>Fixed the error messages for weather checking.</li>
                <li>He has some new dialogue, if you try to get <a href="http://www.drdowasure.com/gaster/">Gaster</a> to talk to him...</li>
                <li>A few more misc tweaks, mostly behind the scenes stuff.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
        </div>
        <div class="ver">
            <div class="centerheadsm"><b>---1.3.1---</b>
            <div class="ctr">(10/17/20)</div></div>
            <ul>
                <li>Fixed weather checking (I swear this is the last time... probably). Non-US urls SHOULDN'T give any more trouble, and if they do, S will direct you to another way of inputting it. Please let me know if this gives you any issues! As a result of this change...</li>
                <li>There is now a toggle in the config menu for Celsius vs Fahrenheit! You should be able to switch between them seamlessly.</li>
                <li>Changed the date/time/etc on the bottom of S's menu to have a slightly smaller font, to give it more room.</li>
                <li>Added a bunch more dialogue for falling asleep and waking up!</li>
                <li>Added a few extra lines of dialogue in various places.</li>
                <li>Balloon files will now be hosted separately from S's update files, so fresh installs will no longer want to redownload the balloon files.</li>
                <li>Fixed some typos, fixed a few small bugs, tightened up some code and made the formatting nicer.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
        </div>

            <div class="centerhead"><b>=====1.3.0=====</b>

            <ul>
                <li>Added an Autumn themed shell! It comes with an accessory you can put on him with his right click menu.</li>
                <li>Fixed weather checking again. From now on I should be able to update it on my end without needing to patch S.</li>
                <li>You may need to reset your weather location if you're outside the US. However, you should now be able to get the tempurature in celcius if you use a page in celcius!</li>
                <li>Auto weather checks will no longer open the balloon, and should happen completely silently.</li>
                <li>S can fall asleep randomly now! He may sometimes have bad dreams; you can pet him to make him have more pleasant dreams for a while.</li>
                <li>S can pick up <a href="dusty.html">Obsidian</a> if you drag her onto him! Don't do it until I update Dusty, though, or it may behave weirdly.</li>
                <li>More dialogue and bugfixes all around.</li>
            </ul>

                <li>Fixed a bug where dragging S around sometimes caused an empty balloon to pop up.</li>

            <ul>
        <li>Updated the balloon. If the balloon looks strange while using the Timeline menu, you can download it here, or change your balloon to Purple Soul and ask S to update from the 'do something for you' menu!</li>
        <li>Added a new secret mode! If you don't mind spoilers and want to know how to unlock it, check above under the spoiler tab.</li>
        <li<>S can now check the weather! If you've checked the weather recently, or if you have auto weather updates on, he may comment on the weather randomly!</li>
        <li>S will now comment if you move him far enough across your screen, or move him onto a secondary monitor.</li>
        <li>S can now comment on how much trash you're hoarding in your recycle bin!</li>
        <li>He may also comment if you plug in a tablet, if you allow him to see programs on your PC.</li>
        <li>S can now display email headers when he checks your email!</li>
        <li>You can boop his nose if your friendship is high!</li>
