# s-the-skeleton

This repository is where I host the latest update files for all my ghosts and balloons, and I suppose as a backup download for them should Mediafire ever go down. It's also a small website explaining what ghosts are, what each of my ghosts are about, and providing download links to them. You should check out the website if you want to actually download my ghosts. Why are you people cloning the repository? If you're someone who has cloned this repository, please explain.

Anyways, you should go here to read more about my projects. https://zichqec.github.io/s-the-skeleton/index.html
