		<h1>Upgrade from Old Versions of YAYA</h1>
		
		<p>This guide assumes you were originally working with a version of the GT Template, though it will work even if you are not.</p>
		
		<p>When upgrading from old versions of YAYA, there are a few possible versions you might have. You may be able to skip some of these steps. If you have any questions, please do ask.</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>If you have a folder called <b>system</b> in your <b>ghost/master/</b>  folder, delete it</li>
			<li>If you have a folder called <b>messagetxt.txt</b> in your <b>ghost/master/</b>  folder, delete it</li>
			<li>If you have a file called <b>system_config.txt</b> in your <b>ghost/master/</b>  folder, cut and paste anything in it (except the bits that call dic files) into yaya.txt, and then delete system_config.txt</li>
			<li>Download the system dictionary files <a href="https://github.com/ponapalt/yaya-dic">here</a> (you can click Code>Download Zip), extract them, and copy the <b>yaya_base</b> folder into your <b>ghost/master/</b> folder. Not the contents of it, the whole folder. <u>You do not need the other files that you downloaded and can ignore them</u></li>
			<li>In yaya_base/config.dic, make sure <b>SHIORI3FW.AUTO_DATA_CONVERT</b> is set to <b>1</b>, and <b>SHIORI3FW.REF_ACCEL</b> is set to <b>0</b> (You can skip this step if you know what auto data convert is and were not originally using it)</li>
			<li>In yaya.txt, delete <b>include, system_config.txt</b> and replace it with <b>dicdir, yaya_base</b></li>
			<li>In yaya.txt, run a search for <b>messagetxt</b>. If you find this option, replace it with <b>msglang,english</b> (or your preferred supported language). If you have neither of these, add <b>msglang,english</b> (or your preferred supported language)</li>
			<li>Replace your yaya.dll with the latest version of yaya.dll (yaya.dll download <a href="https://github.com/ponapalt/yaya-shiori/releases">here</a> - download the regular yaya.zip of the latest version)</li>
			<li>In your aitalk.dic, run a search for a function called <b>AiTalk</b>. If it is named <b>AiTalk</b>, rename it to <b>OnAiTalk</b></li>
			<li>Run a search in your ghost's files for a function called <b>OnChoiceSelect</b>. If it does not exist, add this function into a file somewhere:
<pre>
//This bit of code is what makes menu options that don't start with On direct to Select.options instead. Remove or comment it if you prefer!
OnChoiceSelect
{
    EVAL("Select.%(reference0)")
}
</pre>
			</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>To check and see if the update worked, you can use <b>%(LICENSE[0])</b> to check the version number of your current installation of YAYA.</p>
		
		<p>If you are not able to run %(LICENSE[0]) directly through script input and would like to, there's a guide for that <a href="https://zichqec.github.io/s-the-skeleton/envelopes_script_input">here</a>.</p>
