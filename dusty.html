        <h1>Dusty</h1>
        <img src="img/Dusty_00.png" alt="Dusty and Obsidian" width="250" height="300" class="center">
        <br>
        <div class="cntr"><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/file/rw69ptuypj9097u/dusty_and_obsidian_v1.0.9.nar/file">Download their latest .nar file here!</a></div>
        <p>Dusty is one of my interpretations of Gaster, from Undertale! He also has his cat Obsidian. He has some backstory, but most of his focus is on his Wingdings functions. He can help you learn to read Wingdings! Or any dingbats font you like!</p>
        <br>
        <div class="centerreg"><div class="sBs"><img src="img/Dusty_01.png" alt="Translating out of Wingdings" class="center" width="514" height="480"></div> <div class="sBs"><img src="img/Dusty_02.png" alt="Translating into Wingdings" class="center"width="866" height="480"></div></div>
        <br>
        <p>He can translate things in and out of Wingdings, and has a small selection of games and quizzes as well! These games let you earn G, which you can use to buy items for Obsidian.</p>
        <br>
        <img src="img/Dusty_03.png" alt="User categories" width="512" height="505" class="center">
        <br>
        <p>The games draw words from different categories that you can toggle on and off, and you can create your own categories too with as many words as you like!</p>
        <br>
        <img src="img/Dusty_04.png" alt="Obsidian being cute" width="520" height="417" class="center">
        <br>
        <p>Obsidian has a much simpler set of functions, which are all very silly. You can also drag and drop her onto Dusty to have him pick her up!</p>
        <br>
        <p>I hope to keep adding more in the future, so keep an eye out for updates!</p>

	<h1>Ghosts that can hold Obsidian</h1>
	<p>Not only can you drag and drop Obsidian onto Dusty to make him hold her, you can also do it with some other ghosts too! Here's a list of the ones I know about:</p>
	<ul margin=75%>
		<li><a href="https://zdzisiu.github.io/Ukagaka/md.html">MiniDev</a> by Zdzisiu</li>
		<li><a href="https://dj-dusk.github.io/Elsen/">Elsen</a> by DJDusk</li>
		<li><a href="https://azura-levidre.000webhostapp.com/azura">Azura</a> by Levidre</li>
		<li><a href="https://zichqec.github.io/s-the-skeleton/s_the_skeleton.html">S the Skeleton</a> by Zichqec</li>
		<li><a href="https://fursie-does-art.tumblr.com/riccukagaka">Riccardo</a> by Fursie</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If you're a ghost dev and would like to have your ghost hold Obsidian, you can download my guide on <a href="https://zichqec.github.io/s-the-skeleton/functions.html">this page!</a></p>
	<p>If you're having trouble with a ghost holding Obsidian, make sure both that ghost and Dusty are up to date, and try reloading them. That usually fixes the issue. If not, feel free to contact me and I'll see what I can do!</p>

		<label class="collapsible">Version 1.0.x - Initial Release</label>
		<div class="collapsible-content">
			<div class="ver">
					<div class="centerhead"><b>=====1.0.0=====</b>
						<div class="ctr">(8/1/20)</div></div>
					<ul>
						<li>Initial release</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
				
				<div class="ver">
					<div class="centerheadsm"><b>---1.0.1---</b>
					<div class="ctr">(8/30/20)</div></div>
					<ul>
						<li>Fixed the weather glitch.</li>
						<li>If you have auto weather checks on, Dusty will now check the weather within a few minutes of booting.</li>
						<li>Improved the weather display on the main menu slightly.</li>
						<li>Fixed Dusty randomly saying 0 or 1 in his balloon.</li>
						<li>Fixed a stray pixel (with righteous indignation).</li>
						<li>Added a new menu to the font menu that displays all fonts installed on your computer in a list!</li>
						<li>Made Obsidian's window stick to Dusty if he's holding her.</li>
						<li>Random dialogue will no longer happen while you're in the middle of confiding/gushing.</li>
						<li>Fixed a bug where dialogue about your computer just wouldn't show up.</li>
					</ul>
					 <br>
				</div>
				
				<div class="ver">
					<div class="centerheadsm"><b>---1.0.2---</b>
					<div class="ctr">(10/2/20)</div></div>
					<ul>
						<li>Fixed the weather glitch again, it should be less of an issue from now on! If you're outside the US, you might have to reset your location.</li>
						<li>When you check the weather, Dusty will also list the time of the sunrise and sunset in your area!</li>
						<li>Auto weather checks will no longer open a balloon and will happen completely silently.</li>
						<li>Added the option to opt in to beta updates.</li>
						<li>Obsidian can now be held by <a href="https://zichqec.github.io/s-the-skeleton/s_the_skeleton.html">S</a> if you have them both up to date!</li>
						<li>Some other small bugfixes.</li>
					</ul>
					 <br>
				</div>
				
				<div class="ver">
					<div class="centerheadsm"><b>---1.0.3---</b>
					<div class="ctr">(10/2/20)</div></div>
					<ul>
						<li>Fixed a bug with S holding Obsidian.</li>
					</ul>
					 <br>
				</div>
				
				<div class="ver">
					<div class="centerheadsm"><b>---1.0.4---</b>
					<div class="ctr">(10/18/20)</div></div>
					<ul>
						<li>Dusty's weather checking is fixed again, and there is now a toggle for Fahrenheit or Celsius in his menu. Please tell me if anything goes wrong with this!</li>
						<li>Made it so that if another ghost talks to Dusty while he's holding Obsidian, he'll ignore them. This is a placeholder dialogue to prevent weird visual bugs until I get a better fix in.</li>
						<li>Added a few new dialogues.</li>
						<li>Fixed a bug where having translation tooltips on would cause timeout messages.</li>
					</ul>
					 <br>
				</div>
				
				<div class="ver">
					<div class="centerheadsm"><b>---1.0.5---</b>
					<div class="ctr">(10/18/20)</div></div>
					<ul>
						<li>Fixed a typo in the weather location dialogue.</li>
					</ul>
					 <br>
				</div>
				
				<div class="ver">
					<div class="centerheadsm"><b>---1.0.6---</b>
					<div class="ctr">(10/17/20)</div></div>
					<ul>
						<li>Other ghosts will now be able to hold Obsidian, should the dev choose to make their ghost compatible! It's a lot of work, so I don't expect many devs to do it, however...</li>
						<li><a href="https://zdzisiu.github.io/Ukagaka/md.html">MiniDev</a> can now hold Obsidian if both ghosts are up to date!</li>
						<li>Dusty also has some basic commu conversations set up with MiniDev, to hopefully be expanded at a later date.</li>
						<li>MiniDev has also been added to Dusty's submenu for talking about other ghosts!</li>
						<li>Changed the way S picking up Obsidian works. Please make sure you have both ghosts up to date before you try this! Also, if you ever have trouble with S/another ghost not picking up Obsidian anymore, reloading them seems to help.</li>
						<li>Offscreen dialogue should now happen immediately upon Dusty being moved out of bounds.</li>
						<li>Fixed a bug where timeout dialogue was happening when it shouldn't.</li>
						<li>Fixed some misc bugs and typos. Also, some code optimization. Expect a lot of optimization in 1.1.0, whenever I get to that...</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
				</div>
				
				<div class="ver">
					<div class="centerheadsm"><b>---1.0.7---</b>
					<div class="ctr">(11/1/20)</div></div>
					<ul>
						<li>Fixed an issue with Dusty not recognizing he'd met MiniDev if he talked to him normally.</li>
						<li>Hopefully fixed a bug where a duplicate Obsidian would appear if you updated them while she was being held by Dusty.</li>
						<li>Hopefully fixed a bug where Dusty's commu loop prevention was actually causing him to get stuck in loops...</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
				</div>
				
				<div class="ver">
					<div class="centerheadsm"><b>---1.0.8---</b>
					<div class="ctr">(11/6/20)</div></div>

					</ul>
					<br>
				</div>
				
				<div class="ver">
					<div class="centerheadsm"><b>---1.0.9---</b>
					<div class="ctr">(11/17/20)</div></div>
					<ul>
						<li>Fixed an issue where lowercase a was being translated as lowercase s in the Translate From Wingdings function.</li>
						<li>Fixed an issue where the links in the Translate From Wingdings function were overlapping improperly.</li>
						<li>Fixed an issue where Obsidian sometimes spoke in the custom font, if you had asked Dusty to change most of his dialogue to it.</li>
						<li>Fixed an issue where their blip in animations would play twice if S was present while booting.</li>
						<li>Fixed an issue where email headers were completely broken.</li>
