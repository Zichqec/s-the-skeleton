        <h1>X. Template</h1>
        <img src="img/X_TemplateThumb.png" alt="X. Template" width="280" height="250" class="center">
        <br>
        <div class="cntr"><a href="https://www.mediafire.com/file/rh7yvgal4s52h2a/x_template_yaya_v1.0.4.nar/file">Download the latest .nar file here!</a></div>
        <p>X. Template is a template ghost I made! It's intended for ghost developers who already know how ghosts work, generally. If you're new to making ghosts, I suggest <a href="http://ashido.com/ukagaka/">Zarla's GT Template</a> instead; it includes a walkthrough to get you started!</p>
        <p>So, if you're not a new ghost dev, why should you use X. Template? Well, for one I'm sure you've noticed that once you don't need the walkthrough comments anymore, they're a hassle to get rid of. Haven't we all had the experience of trying to remove Triangle but he keeps popping up in unexpected places? X. Template starts you without those things. Here are some differences with X. Template.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Differences users will see</h3>
        <div class="ver">
            <ul>
                <li>When installing a ghost with X. Template, you'll be offered the options to call or change to them in dialogue.</li>
                <li>When checking emails, the ghost will offer to display the headers.</li>
                <li>Automatic update checks are built in, and will notify the user if a new update is available.</li>
                <li>The ghost will track when they were last closed, and comment if it's been a long time when you open them.</li>
                <li>The ghost will say 'happy new year' as the year rolls over.</li>
                <li>When changing shells, the ghost will stay in the same position on screen.</li>
                <li>Right clicking the ghost will not cause their personal menu to open.</li>
                <li>Changing name/birthday/pronouns will lead back to the config menu.</li>
                <li>Offers a changelog after updating!</li>
                <li>Hitting the ghost for the first time will pop up a confirmation dialogue, to prevent accidental punches.</li>
                <li>You can type in the name of the month you were born instead of just the number.</li>
                <li>Petting ghosts repeatedly without taking your mouse off of them will have special dialogue.</li>
                <li>Config menu has toggle buttons, and also has options for hemisphere, and to opt in to beta updates.</li>
                <li>Always has dialogue when done installing something, even if it's something niche like a calendar skin.</li>
                <li>There is no title system, since I never include it in my ghosts.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <br>
        <h3>Differences devs will see</h3>
        <div class="ver"> 
            <ul>
                <li>Very few tutorial comments, all code is formatted consistently and has been cleaned up where possible.</li>
                <li>A Kero is not present unless you add them in.</li>
                <li>Uses the new seriko definition.</li>
                <li>The test variable will only show up if the variable 'debug' is set to 1, hiding it from the user.</li>
                <li>When 'debug' is set to 1, you can use the test variable by pressing V when the ghost is the active window.</li>
                <li>Sakurascript commands, such as those to open the calendar or set a wallpaper, have been separated from dialogue with --s. This makes it a bit easier to create ghosts with multiple modes, as you won't need to copy the commands into each line of dialogue.</li>
                <li>All menu related envelopes are optimized and have been moved to word.dic.</li>
                <li>Anchor.dic has been updated to allow https links as well as http.</li>
                <li>Removed some functions from etc.dic that were non-functional, and some other redundant functions.</li>
                <li>Much fewer global variables, some variables have been changed to arrays, notably the birthday variables (bithday[0] to see the written birthday and birthday[1] to see it written DD/MM) and the passhour/min/sec variables (are now runtime[0], [1], and [2]).</li>
                <li>Commu.dic should be ready to use, and offers a method of doing commu dialogue that is much more readable. From 1.0.3 onward, there is also a non-interrupting system so that the ghost will wait to respond to commu dialogues until it's not doing anything else, and a better loop prevention system that is less awkward!</li>
                <li>You can have the template ghost check if there is a new version of the template.</li>
            </ul>

                <div class="centerheadsm"><b>---1.0.4---</b>
                <div class="ctr">(1/5/21)</div></div>
                <ul>
					<li>Removed some testing stuff I left in commu.dic by mistake</li>
					<li>Uncommented some stuff that I had commented in aitalk.dic by mistake</li>
					<li>Added some clarification about nonoverlap in aitalk.dic</li>
				</ul>
            <br>
        </div>
		<div class="ver">
                <div class="centerheadsm"><b>---1.0.3---</b>
                <div class="ctr">(1/5/21)</div></div>
                <ul>
					<li>Fixed an incorrect variable name when updates finish. 'updateavailable' should be 'AutoUpdates[1]'</li>
					<li>Changed "'o clock" in the hour notifications to "o'clock"</li>
					<li>Added a better loop prevention system in commu dialogue</li>
					<li>Added a non-interrupt system in commu dialogue</li>
					<li>Slightly restructured things in OnSecondChange</li>
					<li>Checking for an update from the ghost's menu now actually starts an update, not just a check (sorry, I keep changing my mind lol)</li>
					<li>Changed the recommendations for UpdateVars, now it has a proper check to see if the variable exists</li>
					<li>Made a tweak to nowday and nowmonth. If you call them and include 'last' or 'next' as the second argument, you'll get the previous day/month or next day/month, respectively.</li>
					<li>Added the Capitalize function</li>
					<li>When done creating a .nar file, the ghost will give you a link to click that will open the folder you made the .nar in.</li>
				</ul>
            <br>
        </div>
		<div class="ver">
                <div class="centerheadsm"><b>---1.0.2---</b>
                <div class="ctr">(11/26/20)</div></div>
                <ul>
					<li>Fixed email checking again, I forgot to change the name of 1 variable and I'm very sorry for the trouble.</li>
					<li>Fixed the aitalkinterval being set to 6 minutes instead of 5 during the first boot, and adjusted a check in the config menu as well.</li>
					<li>Removed some unnecessary brackets in the config menu and some spots in etc, added in some semicolons instead.</li>
					<li>Made the RSS/Headline failure dialogue tell the user what error it got even if it isn't a recognized error.</li>
					<li>Added a note about OnSNTPFailure.</li>
					<li>Added a check for ] characters when setting wallpapers, as a ] in the file name will cause the wallpaper command to break. X. Template will now tell you that you need to remove any ]s from the file name first.</li>
				</ul>
            <br>
        </div>
		 <div class="ver">
                <div class="centerheadsm"><b>---1.0.1---</b>
                <div class="ctr">(11/06/20)</div></div>
                <ul>
					<li>Fixed email checking, it should no longer spew headers all over the place before you've asked.</li>
					<li>Fixed the header code, it's much simpler, cleaner, and works properly now.</li>
					<li>Fixed an issue where the auto updates button wasn't appearing in the config menu.</li>
					<li>Changed some options in the config menu to display a 'Back to menu' and 'I'm done' button, instead of clicking the balloon to go back.</li>
					<li>Changed how new variables are added in updates, and removed that section from the 'Some YAYA tips' file since it's no longer relevant (new explanation is in Bootend because it's very short)</li>
					<li>Changed the URL that links to the template in the right click menu; it now correctly points to X. Template's page instead of the website's homepage.</li>
					<li>Changed wallpaper code so that it can see what OS you're running without needing the Saori, meaning that the span option should always appear if available.</li>
					<li>Changed the function that checks the template's version number, the changelog will now be displayed instantly.</li>
                </ul>
            <br>
