        <p>Does ukagaka development seem intimidating? Does it sound like a huge task that would take forever to complete? Do you wish things could be easier?</p>
		
		<p>Or perhaps, are you an experienced developer wanting to try something new? Looking for something more open, with fewer features to decide whether or not you should remove? Wanting to free yourself from the standard setup and make things your own way?</p>
		
		<p>Introducing the Simplicity Template! A template built on the philosophy that <i>content</i> is what matters the most, and all other is secondary. There are very few functions here, only a few basic things such as petting, random dialogue, and a talk rate menu. Even the user's name, pronouns, and birthday, are all decided through SSP's preferences menu.</p>
		
		<p>If you're skeptical, I urge you to give it a chance! I, too, was skeptical when I first considered making a ghost without a template, but once I finally tried it and made <a href="https://zichqec.github.io/s-the-skeleton/needle">Needle</a>, my perspective totally shifted, and now I need the freedom that having no template provides. This template attempts to strike a balance, giving you an extremely basic setup instead of throwing you completely into the deep end.</p>
		
		<p>I really think content is what matters most in a ghost! Think a lot about what you want to <i>do</i> with your ghost; there's so many things they can do and be! "X character but on your desktop" is a very common angle, but you don't have to go that route! Suspension of disbelief is 100% a thing in ghosts. It could be that you're visiting them somewhere, or they're visiting you, or you live together, or you work together. What places other than your desktop might they be? Or what place might they think your desktop is? And what about the user? Are they just a person playing with a desktop toy, or are they drawn into the world as well? It can be vague, or you can pick something wild, like having the user find out they've actually been a werewolf the whole time!</p>
		
		<p>So with all of those possibilities in mind, having fewer functions dictated by the template gives you a lot of freedom to explore what your ghost can be! Plus, it means you don't have to spend hours filling in functions that you're not really interested in, only to get burned out before you ever reach the fun and interesting content you wanted to add in the first place! I hope that keeping it simple will make it easier for folks new to ghost coding to get in as well, since it should be less overwhelming to start out with.</p>
		
		<p>Give it a try! You can always add in more features from other templates if you decide you want them!</p>

						<li>Fixed an issue where LastTalk was not initialized, nor reset upon boot.</li>
						<li>Made username into a variable instead of using the environment variable version. This means you can use things like TOUPPER on it now.</li>
						<li>Changed the surfaces to be a different width/height/color than the Minimum YAYA Template, so they are possible to distinguish now. The sakura character also has a star on it to distinguish it from the kero.</li>

					<ul>
						<li>Updated the YAYA as SHIORI dic files with the latest security patches</li>

						<li>Removed information about AUTO_DATA_CONVERT in the readme, as the information was actually incorrect</li>

						<li>Fixed an issue where the talk rate menu's back button was labelled improperly and directed to a non-existent event</li>

				<div class="centerheadsm"><b>---1.0.3---</b>

						<li>Added a note about OnInitialize being a NOTIFY event</li>
						<li>Added OnWindowStateRestore to prevent an oversight where unminimizing would use the default surfaces, which might not be suitable for all ghosts</li>
