This is the default shell for FLUX player. If you want to install other shells, you can find some here https://zichqec.github.io/s-the-skeleton/flux.html , or you can install any shells that are compatible with the ghost FLELE. Most should work, let me know if you find any that don't!

This shell is compatible with FLELE, too!

The hotspots are as follows:

Top of head - Petting
Face - Play song/Next song
Synthesizers - Stop song
Feet - Clear playlist
Headphones(the side he puts his hand on) - Open music menu(music bar in FLELE)

FLUX is a pseudonym for one of my OCs, as well as being the name of the music player. He comes with a very small amount of custom dialogue, and a dressup for changing the color of his synthesizers.

Please note: If you're not on windows, his arms and head might flicker. It's an unfortunate side effect of how I've set up his animations, but there isn't really a good way to avoid it.
