Thanks for downloading this FLUX/FLELE shell of Cibus! She's an OC of mine that doesn't belong to any fandom, and that's all the explanation you're getting lol. I wanted to try out making a FLELE shell with a character I'm unlikely to make a ghost for in the future, to see what all I could do with it and push myself to learn more about SERIKO (And definitely not because I'm procrastinating on other ghosts). Then, several months later after I got the idea to make FLUX, I wanted to update her shell to show off some of what FLUX can do! She now has a set of dialogue for when she's playing music, a set of dialogue for when she isn't playing music, all the SERIKO is much better, she has new dressups, she's been shrunk to the correct size, and she has new expressions! I made a lot of updates haha. And there may be more in the future, now!

Anyways, here are her buttons. You have to double click the hotspots to get them to work, except for petting.

Face - Play
Shoulders - Stop
Dress (Belly and down) - Menu (If you're using FLELE, this can be right clicked to bring up playlist options, too!)
Right foot - Song Bar(FLELE), Music Menu(FLUX)
Left foot - Clear Playlist
Top of her head - Pet

If you right click her, you can accessorize her a little with the option Clothes/Dressup.
If you're using FLUX, you can still right click to accessorize, or you can use the Dressups option in the main menu.
