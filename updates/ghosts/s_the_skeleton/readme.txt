Hello, and thank you for downloading the S ghost! S is an Undertale based OC of mine who I draw entirely too much. (No, he's not a Sans.) This ghost does contain a lot of dark themes and convoluted writing, you have been warned. I mostly just made this for my own sake, but if he can entertain you for a while then I'm glad! If you haven't used a ghost before, basic ghost instructions are at the bottom of this readme!

S is still somewhat of a work in progress, I'd like to add a lot more to the menus and add lots more dialogue, but I hope you'll enjoy what I've made so far!
S features a simple relationship system; if you're kind to him he'll eventually come to trust and appreciate you. You can hit him if you want, but why would you want to do that?
His menu is somewhat dynamic and will change based on how you're treating him. As you build up more trust you can do different things and give him different items. The way he reacts to these things will also change.

Possibly his biggest feature is his family menu; S has a large family that you can learn about. Each member can be unlocked by clicking on the purple names that appear in random dialogue, and then you can ask further questions about them in the family menu! Not only that, but as you unlock more family members, more dialogue may be unlocked that involves multiple of them! It's worth coming back and asking the same questions again, there may be more/different answers.


Many thanks to Zarla for writing the template and walkthrough that got me started on ghost making, I couldn't be making this without it. Links to her stuff and the walkthrough are at the top of the right click menu!
You can also find my links and links to more about S at the top of the right click menu.
Thanks also to the members of the Ukagaka Dream Team Discord server, who have helped me understand some of the ghost functions that are a little too complicated for me, it really made the last 10% of the ghost so much easier to do!
And thanks also to the members of the EVN Discord server, who have put up with my off-topic ramblings about skeletons for months now. If any of you are reading this, hello, and thanks for supporting the stuff I'm making even though it's likely not relevant to your interests <3

If you find any bugs or typos, or have other feedback, please do contact me and let me know! I want to make S as solid as I possibly can, but sometimes I'm too zoomed in to catch the little mistakes.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you've not used a ghost before, here's a basic rundown.

-Double click on his body to open his personal menu.
-Don't double click on his face, or you'll punch him. (There's a confirmation dialogue, so don't worry too much about hitting him by accident.)
-You can move your cursor (without clicking) back and forth over the top of his head to pet him, but be careful! If you rub the tender spots on his head he won't appreciate it.
-Right click anywhere on him to bring up the SSP menu, which you can use to change ghosts, call more ghosts, or hopefully eventually change his outfit.
-Press T while he's in focus to make him say a random line of dialogue.
-Press R to have him repeat the last line of dialogue.
-Press N to have him comment on what music you have playing, if you have this option turned on in the config menu.
-Hold Ctrl to make dialogue go by faster, but be warned that this goes EXTREMELY fast.
-Press Ctrl U to have him update himself, if an update is available.
-Press Ctrl Shft f12 to bring him back on screen if you can't reach him.
-If you want him to stay on top of your windows, right click him and go to Options>Preferences, go to the Ghost(2) tab, and tick the box that says 'Always Show Foreground' near the top
-If he gets minimized, you can bring him back again by right clicking on the red hoodie icon in your system tray and clicking 'Iconify'.

He can also do basic ghost functions such as:

-Checking your email
-Emptying your recycle bin
-Reading RSS feeds
-Showing your system information
-Open SSPs calendar

These functions can be found under the 'Do something for you' option in his double click menu, and you can find other config options under 'Change some settings'!
