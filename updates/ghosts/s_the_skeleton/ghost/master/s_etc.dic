	-Added a new secret mode! If you don't mind spoilers and want to know how to unlock it, you can find the answer on my website \_a[https://zichqec.github.io/s-the-skeleton/index.html]here\_a.\n\n/
	-S can now check the weather! If you've checked the weather recently, or if you have auto weather updates on, he may comment on the weather randomly!\n\n/
	-S will now comment if you move him far enough across your screen, or move him onto a secondary monitor.\n\n/
	-S can now comment on how much trash you're hoarding in your recycle bin!\n\n/
	-He may also comment if you plug in a tablet, if you allow him to see programs on your PC.\n\n/
	-S can now display email headers when he checks your email!\n\n/
	-You can boop his nose if your friendship is high!\n\n/
	-Lots of new dialogue, patched bugs, a few new expressions, and cleaned up code! Drastically less spaghetti.\n\n/
	-Balloons and position on screen will now sync across shells.\n\n/
	-You can opt in to beta updates! This is intended for folks on the Ukagaka Dream Team Discord server.
