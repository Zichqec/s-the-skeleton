When you enter the timeline menu, it undoes all stickies so that it doesn't keep stacking them and break stuff. Then at the end of the text, it moves the 3rd character invisibly to S's position. Then it stickies them again. I have the 3rd character move to S because mine somehow got way off the screen at one point and I could ONLY get it back with the move command...

That's a shame because I don't want to touch that one but it's so long to scroll past. May investigate this further
