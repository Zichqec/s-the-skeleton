InfoKit,"\s[208]His timeline is pretty different compared to mine.\w8\w8\s[106] Monsters don't even exist in the same way,\w4\s[0] instead it's humans on the surface and mers in the water.\w8\w8\n\n\s[208]It seems as though mers have only recently really been discovered,\w4\s[206] and ah...\w8\w8\s[201] humankind hasn't treated them well, for the most part.\w8\w8\s[104]\n\nBut,\w4 thanks to the efforts of a few humans who love marine life,\w4 things have started to change for the better.\w8\w8\s[0] They've built a rehabilitation center to help injured mers recover and release them back into the ocean.\w8\w8\s[104] That's where the mermaid version of me lived when I met him.":"\0\s[1020]I uh,\w4 kinda ended up in the water when I fell into his timeline.\w8\w8\s[201] Not my favorite place to be,\w4\s[202] but as it turns out,\w4 having both our souls in the same body of water allowed me to hear his voice.\w8\w8\s[201]\n\nAh,\w4 I should mention that humans can't hear mer's voices at all,\w4 nor could I hear it while I was out of water.\w8\w8\s[200] Mers make a lot of different vocalizations, clicks and chirps and the like, but nothing that the humans there can understand.":"\0\s[205]He seemed pretty happy at the center, for the most part.\w8\w8\s[107] Though, I think part of that is just that cheerful is his default.\w8\w8\s[200]\n\nHe's in pretty rough shape,\w4 physically...\w8\w8\s[108] And when I spoke to him,\w4 he did mention that he had a brother and dad previously who are now missing...\w8\w8\s[204] I wish there was something I could do for him.\w8\w8\s[201]\n\nHe's very brave,\w4 keeping up such a cheerful demeanor even while he's hurting so much inside.":"\0\s[106]The staff at the center treat him very kindly,\w4\s[102] and I'm grateful for that.\w8\w8\s[200] They told me he was born and raised in captivity,\w4 so it's unlikely he'll ever actually be released into the ocean.\w8\w8\s[106]\n\nTruthfully, though, I get the impression he wouldn't want to leave anyways.\w8\w8\s[205] The center is the first place to really show him kindness,\w4 and to him that makes it home.\w8\w8\s[104] He'd miss his human friends if he left.",,
InfoSmol,"\0\s[0]Ah,\w4 that one?\w8\w8\s[205] Well, from what I could gather, that timeline was a sort of...\w8\w8 swap\w4 of mine.\w8\w8\s[0] I took the place of my first son, and anAbbi took the place of my partner.\w8\w8\s[200]\n\nBut ah,\w4 since the timelines changed,\w4\s[204] it's just the two of them now.\w8\w8\s[108] It's very clear that he misses his brother and other dad dearly.":"\0\s[200]It's...\w8\w8 weird,\w4 thinking about his connection with my first son.\w8\w8\s[206] When I look at him,\w4 I almost feel like I can see my first son in him, in some ways...\w8\w8\s[302]\n\nBut it's not him,\w4 not exactly.\w8\w8\s[303] I guess it's more like looking in a mirror and seeing a blurry image,\w4\s[300] but when I look away he isn't really there.":"\0\s[206]He can't speak.\w8\w8\s[202] But ah,\w4 that doesn't seem to stop him from making himself known.\w8\w8\s[104] He's very energetic and eager to make friends,\w4\s[107] and just about pounced on me when I first appeared.\w8\w8\s[103]\n\nHe's a good kid.",,
