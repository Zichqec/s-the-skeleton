It's a shell! I don't know if Dusty is ever going to get more than 1 shell. If I end up making a second shell for him, it might be his original ECHO design?

Or perhaps I'll give him some comfy clothes, that'd be nice.

I'm a little tired of working on him though, honestly. Maybe once I get away from him for a while I'll feel more like giving him another shell. Who knows!

Thanks for being that 1 in 1000 kind of person who reads all the readmes, you're super cool mdude, whoever you are.
