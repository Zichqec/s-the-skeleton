Hello and thanks for downloading the Dusty ghost!

Dusty is one of my interpretations of Gaster, from Undertale. He was originally created as a part of the ECHO Gaster Community Project, which you can find a link to at the top of the right click menu. (Be warned that his design and my art style have changed a lot since then)
Being a Gaster, he has a lot of functionality related to wingdings! He can teach you about wingdings, translate things in and out of wingdings, and has a few different games to help you practice.

He also has some minor backstory he can give you, as well as some more general functions you can find in the 'do something' menu. His focus is mostly on the wingdings functions instead of having lots of dialogue, but I do hope to add more dialogue in future updates!

There's also his cat, Obsidian. She has a much smaller menu with some silly functions in it that will hopefully make you smile! You can also drag and drop her onto Dusty if you want him to hold her for a little while. (If you need her to jump down so you can access his menu, double click him a few times and she'll eventually get down)

I hope to keep improving this ghost's functions and dialogue in the future, so keep an eye out for updates! I have auto update checks on by default, but he will never update without your approval, he'll just let you know when one is available. You can turn this off in the config menu.

If you find any bugs or typos, no matter how small, please do get in contact and let me know! You can find me on Deviantart, Tumblr, or Twitter as @Zichqec. I promise I'll be eternally grateful, even if you've just found a single letter that needs capitalizing.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you've not used a ghost before, here's a basic rundown.

-Double clicking will open the personal menu for whichever character you're clicking on. Dusty has all the important ghost functions and the wingdings functions, Obsidian just has some fun stuff.
-You can move your cursor (without clicking) back and forth over Dusty's head to pet him, or anywhere on Obsidian's body.
-Right click anywhere on him to bring up the SSP menu, which you can use to change ghosts, call more ghosts, or close them.
-Press T while he's in focus to make them say a random line of dialogue.
-Press R to have them repeat the last line of dialogue.
-Hold Ctrl to make dialogue go by faster, but be warned that this goes EXTREMELY fast.
-Press Ctrl U to have him update himself, if an update is available.
-Press Ctrl Shft f12 to bring them back on screen if you can't reach them.
-If you want them to stay on top of your windows, right click Dusty and go to Options>Preferences, go to the Ghost(2) tab, and tick the box that says 'Always Show Foreground' near the top
-If they get minimized, you can bring them back again by right clicking on the soul icon in your system tray and clicking 'Minimize'.

He can also do basic ghost functions such as:

-Checking the weather
-Checking your email
-Emptying your recycle bin
-Reading RSS feeds
-Showing your system information
-Open SSPs calendar


Weather checking code by Vita, @yuyudev on twitter. Modified somewhat by me to simplify it for my purposes, you can find the original code with all the original functions here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qMyEEsunVIFGBBA97hC9i9IRRsx5ahDQ66QWPWVTMh4
(Thank you Vita for helping me with all this regex stuff <3)
