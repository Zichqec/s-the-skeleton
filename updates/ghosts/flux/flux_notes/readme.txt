A balloon made for the Lulo ghost, which you can find here: https://zichqec.github.io/s-the-skeleton/lulo.html

It has three separate colors, for her three separate modes. Blue for Awake mode, Pink for Sleepy mode, and Purple for Asleep mode.

The Kero balloon only has the purple color, because I do not intend to use any characters other than the Sakura for her ghost.
