Thanks for downloading this FLELE shell of Cibus! She's an OC of mine that doesn't belong to any fandom, and that's all the explanation you're getting lol. I wanted to try out making a FLELE shell with a character I'm unlikely to make a ghost for in the future, to see what all I could do with it and push myself to learn more about Seriko (And definitely not because I'm procrastinating on other ghosts).

Anyways, here are her buttons. You have to double click the hotspots to get them to work, except for petting.

Face - Play
Shoulders - Stop
Dress (Belly and down) - Menu (This can be right clicked to bring up playlist options, too!)
Right foot - Song Bar
Left foot - Clear Playlist
Top of her head - Pet

If you right click her, you can accessorize her a little with the option Clothes/Dressup.

You can find more ghosts/balloons/etc from me at https://zichqec.github.io/s-the-skeleton/index.html

The english FLELE patch is by Zarla http://www.ashido.com/huntersmoker/flele.html
I've added some simple dialogue for Cibus to it. To install it, copy 1.dic from her shell folder into SSP/ghost/flele_aya/ghost/master, and overwrite the 1.dic already present.
Since this was built on Zarla's patch, it also includes dialogue for her FLELE shells, Jockey and Gordon Freeman. It does not contain dialogue for any other shells that have been customized in this way, so if you have other shells with unique dialogue you may not want to add this one. Cibus will work perfectly fine without making this change, she just won't say anything.

As a side note, her size is NOT consistent with my other ghosts. If you want her to be around accurate size (for some reason), set her shell scaling to 75%.
