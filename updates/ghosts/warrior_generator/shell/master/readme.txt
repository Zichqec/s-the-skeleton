Default Cat Shell v1.0.0
This is the default shell that comes with the Warrior Generator ghost https://zichqec.github.io/s-the-skeleton/warrior_generator.html

It comes with a variety of dressups to create basic cat designs. This is intended to inspire creative ideas for cat designs, but you are free to take screenshots of the designs you create and share them, as well as upload them to places like Toyhou.se.

DO NOT sell any designs created with this generator. If this generator inspires you to create your own character, and you make your own art for it, you can do what you like, but do not screenshot/export designs from this generator and sell them to others.

Please note that this shell has special rules when used with the random generator: illegal tortie combinations will not be generated, and heterochromia will be chosen rarely.

Legal tortie combinations are:

Black/Red
Gray/Red
White/Red
Chocolate/Yellow
Cinnamon/Apricot

You can do as you like, but the random generator will only create those combinations.

Also note, the random generator sometimes pulls out combinations whose color values are not close enough to be legal, and are sometimes downright ugly. For the time being, I consider this a small annoyance that allows much more creative freedom, which I think is more valuable.

More combinations may be added in the future.
