Thank you for downloading the Warrior Generator ghost!

This ghost serves as a random design/name/etc generator, and is intended to give you inspiration to create more detailed designs. Also, it's just fun to play with!

This ghost has a dynamic design menu that will change based on what shell you're using, so you or anyone else who is interested is free to create and distribute their own shells! I will gladly provide links to any shells created on my website, here https://zichqec.github.io/s-the-skeleton/warrior_generator.html

Please check the readmes of any shells you use, to see how the dev allows their work to be used.

If you install a new shell and it causes the ghost to give an error and no longer load properly, go into warrior_generator > ghost > master and erase the contents of wg_dressuprules.dic. Switch to a shell that works and reload the ghost, then let the shell author know their shell is causing an error.

If you are interested in creating a shell for this generator, please check the documentation in the warrior_generator folder.

When using the generators, you will be provided with options to save designs you've created. These designs are stored in plain text in the saved_data folder. You can edit them in a text editor if you like, but be very careful to preserve the formatting or strange things may happen! You can also share designs and characters with other people who have this ghost, and they will be able to load them if they put the files into the correct folders.

Also note, designs and characters are separated into folders based on the shell they were made with. Make sure you put them into the right folder!

This ghost will attempt to automatically download the moon phase every time you open it, and every day at noon. If you do not want to use this feature, it can be toggled off on the main menu.

This ghost will also check for new updates once a day. It will never update without your permission, simply notify you if new content is available. This can also be toggled off on the main menu.

I have many more plans for this ghost in the future, so do keep an eye out for those updates!
