Created for the Hydrate ghost by Zdzisiu and Zichqec

You can find more balloons here: https://zichqec.github.io/s-the-skeleton/balloons.html


If you're a ghost creator and would like to include this balloon with your ghost, feel free to do so! Please just leave this readme as-is, and leave me as the craftman. Also note that this balloon is extremely simple and limited.


You can contact me at deviantart.com/zichqec or zichqec.tumblr.com

Many thanks to Zarla for creating the balloon template and walkthrough!
