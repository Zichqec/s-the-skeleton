Hello and thanks for downloading the Lulo ghost beta! I really do appreciate any and all feedback you can give me, so don't hesitate to send me any bugs or typos, no matter how small! I want Lulo to be pretty polished for her proper release.

A lot of functions are missing or half complete right now! The dream submenu is locked off because I ran out of time for it, the friendship system hasn't been fully implemented and still needs to be balanced better, and the items menu is missing a lot of items and surfaces to go with those items, among other things. But with that in mind, I hope you'll still enjoy what I have!

Lulo's main modes are Sleepy and Asleep, she'll go between them based on things like the time of day, the moon phase, how long she's been open, and more! I'm planning to overhaul the system, though, so expect it to change later down the road.

Lulo can do all the standard ghost functions, and even has buttons in her function menu for RSS feeds and fixing the clock. She can also check the weather!

She can save journal entries for you (once you unlock it by talking to her), though please be mindful that the journal entries are saved in plain text, so don't put anything too sensitive in there (like passwords), especially if you're on a shared computer!

She can also act as a music player! You'll have to unlock it by talking to her, but once you do, you can make playlists, save and load them, loop or shuffle them, etc. The volume starts at 100%, you might want to turn it down a little before you play anything. Once you have the music player unlocked, you can press M at any time to bring up the music menu quickly! There are more hotkeys for skipping through songs and such, you can ask her about it in the music settings menu.

She also has a big item/shop menu. You can earn dp (dream points) by interacting with her, and playing games, which you can then spend to buy her consumable items or dressup items! Currently, I've only implemented clothes with basic colors on them, and I'm planning to change them quite a bit later (don't use light yellow right now... just don't), but the system is easily expandable so expect plenty more interesting items later! Items are planned to affect things such as how sleepy she is, but right now that is not implemented.

The interactions in the interact menu are also supposed to affect her sleepiness, but again, they aren't set up for that yet (except for if you read to her, that will eventually make her fall asleep if you don't have music playing). Same goes for petting her and booping her. You can't punch her, by the way, double clicking her face will give her a gentle boop.

Oh, also important to note, some of her dialogue changes based on if S is also open or not! She's planned to have a lot of commu dialogue with him eventually, but that can't happen until I also update S. I'll be working on that soon!

THERE'S SO MUCH MORE WORK TO DO, please forgive the rough edges XD And let me know what you think about any of the features and how they might be improved!
