This is an Undertale Soul-themed balloon that can be used with any ghost you like! Other than the little soul icons, it's fairly plain.
If you don't have the rest of the set, you can find it here: https://www.deviantart.com/zichqec/gallery/73259310/ukagaka


If you're a ghost creator and would like to include this balloon with your ghost, feel free to do so! Please just leave this readme as-is, and leave me as the craftman.

If you'd like to modify this balloon (shift the color to something I haven't, mix two different colors for a two character ghost, etc), feel free to do so, just please credit me as the creator of the base somewhere! If you're new to making balloons and are unsure how to edit this one, you can get in contact with me and I'll do my best to help out!


You can contact me at deviantart.com/zichqec or zichqec.tumblr.com

Many thanks to Zarla for creating the balloon template and walkthrough!
