He used to be an adventurer like you, then he took an arrow in the knee.

This is a very barebones ghost atm. I have some ambitious plans I may or may not try in the future, but for now he'll just sit on your desktop and spout obnoxious guard dialogue at you!

He does not have most of the normal ghost functions accessible. If you set it up in the POP menu, you can have him check your email by going through the right click menu, but that's about it.

You can press T to force him to say something, or just say hello in his menu. You can change holds by clicking on 'Travel', or going to 'Travel to:' in his right click menu. His dialogue will change dynamically based on what hold you're in.

If you find any bugs or have any questions, you can find me at deviantart.com/zichqec or zichqec.tumblr.com!
