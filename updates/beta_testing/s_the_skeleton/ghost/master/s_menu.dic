//I wasn't planning to give this a Select.option, it's just meant to be an empty function for choices that should do nothing. However, since I added dialogue for dragging him around the screen and I made it use \C, it would pop up windows after you closed them if you just nudged him around a bit. This here prevents that by making it clear that the balloon is _definitely_ closed, because you clicked a choice to close it. Might change how this works later, but I think this'll be the quickest and cleanest solution because I used cancelnodialogue everywhere.

// Hey look at this I can put whole menus and things into commented brackets so that I dont have to scroll past a million things :D This is brilliant. ...Hm, but it doesn't seem to work with the config menu... not sure why. That's a shame because I don't want to touch that one but it's so long to scroll past. May investigate this further
