Hey there! This is the default shell for the S the Skeleton ghost. There's really not too much more to say than that.

He has at least one line of dialogue related to this shell, and I'd like to add more in the future. I'd also like to add some more shells, but we'll see how that goes XD

Enjoy the classic look!
