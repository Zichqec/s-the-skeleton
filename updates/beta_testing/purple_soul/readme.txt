This balloon is a variant of my Undertale Soul-themed balloons, and is made to be used with S the Skeleton. If you're interested in the set of balloons, you can find them here: https://www.deviantart.com/zichqec/gallery/73259310/ukagaka

The input boxes might look slightly weird, I was having some issues getting the PNA files to actually work, so I just... got rid of them and did the best I could </3 If anything seems weird, please do let me know!

You can contact me at deviantart.com/zichqec or zichqec.tumblr.com

Many thanks to Zarla for creating the balloon template and walkthrough!
