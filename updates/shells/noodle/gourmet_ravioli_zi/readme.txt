A shell of gourmet ravioli in a can, based lovingly upon the album art of Gourmet Ravioli, by First of October.

Made in celebration of their 5th album, which came out on the same day this shell released!

This shell works for FLELE, FLUX, Hydrate, Noodle, and Presentable Can. You can use it for any combination of them, or all of them at once!

And best of all, it's free! You don't have to pay those high prices for that ravioli, ravioli-oli now!


Hotspots for FLUX/FLELE:

• Menu - Text that reads "Gourmet Ravioli, loaded with cheese"
• Play song - Top rim of can
• Stop song - Bottom rim of can
• Music menu (FLUX) / Music bar (FLELE) - Tomatoes
• Clear playlist - Small circle logo on the bottom right of the can
• Next song - Right half of the light gray area of the can (FLUX only)
• Previous song - Left half of the light gray area of the can (FLUX only)
• Pause song - Dark background behind ravioli design (FLUX only)
• Stop after current song - Small squiggle text on the bottom left of the can (FLUX only)

Hotspot for Presentable Can:

• Double click the ravioli to tap the can

Note that this shell comes with dressups for different colors on the ravioli design. When using this shell with Noodle, changing the ravioli color will cause the color of Noodle's balloon (Noodloon) to match.

Conveniently, this means that if you use it with all 5 of the intended ghosts at once, you could give each one a different ravioli color! It makes telling them apart so easy!
